The project is created in Java Object Oriented Programing. Tank War game is multiplayer game and the Lazarus Game is level based game. The project is based on two games and to learn how to reuse the code. The first one is Tank War Game. The second game is Lazarus Game, which reuses some of the codes from Tank War Game.

## Overview
This program is written in Java, using the Net Beans 8.2 and JDK 1.8. The purpose of this assignment is to provide us with the opportunity to work in a team with one other student to create an object oriented solution for a first game, that can then be re-used for a second game. While doing this, we will be exposed to GUI creation and graphics in Java.

## How to Use the Project
• Open the project in Net Beans 8.2 for best result
• The user must clone the repo and set up as a project with existing source code. Then set up the working directory by right clicking on the newly created project Set Configuration
-> Run -> Working Directory
• Then select the cloned repo and continue
• The user must use the MyGame.TankGame and
lazarusgame.LazarusGame in order to execute the fully
functioning games.
• Afterwards, the program should compile and execute using
the play button and it will prompt the user click on the start game.

## Class Diagrams

## Assumptions
• Tank Wars: For Tank Game we assume that we don’t have to make the graphic looks exactly the same as instructor's example. So we let the health bar and life dots to go with the tank instead of showing them at the bottom of the screen.
• Lazarus Game: For Lazarus Game, we assume that we created multiple levels, so we only did multiple levels and made the map looks exactly the same as the example shown on instruction. Also, when we tried to reuse the objects we created for Tank Wars, we assume that we can simply duplicate the objects and make modifications in order to make it work for our second game.

## Goals of Games
The goal of Tank (the game) is to have multiplayer game. The two tanks move using key controls provided in read me file on the GitHub for the Tank Game. We were not able to get the split screen but we managed to get all the other requirements for the game.
The goal of Lazarus (the game) is to get the character, Lazarus, out of the pit. Boxes are dropped on Lazarus, but once Lazarus hits the stop button the machine that drops boxes is stopped. If a box falls on Lazarus, the game is lost. Lazarus must climb on the boxes to get to the stop button. The kinds of boxes are, from lightest to heaviest: cardboard, wood, stone and metal. If a heavier box falls on a lighter one, the lighter one is crushed. The left and right arrow keys control the movement of Lazarus. There are three levels for the game.

## Conclusion
I have tried to reuse the objects from the Tank Game, and we have an opportunity to examine the reusability of object-oriented programming. Another important thing about this assignment is we have experienced about how to code in a team, and what pair programming is.
One of the toughest projects we have done in our academic career so far.
This is one of the largest learning curves from a project. There was a lot to keep track of before even trying to make the program start running at all.
This was a bit refreshing to use images and frames.
We are still learning to import properly because we feel like if we do, then we are doing something wrong, but it is actually the opposite.
It was difficult to make some work around and a lot of grinding to figure out what was a more optimal solution.
A lot of teamwork and a lot of logical discussing of the code were needed to get through this term project.

## Lessons Learned
• To reuse code. Had more practice with GitHub. 
• Challenges: To work with images and frames.
